They weren't very good, but they existed.\nApple had the Newton out for a while before Palm turned PDAs into a self-named category.\nMicrosoft, Blackberry, Palm, and Nokia all had smartphone OSes years before Apple \"created\" the smartphone.\nMy guess is that someone else will tweak the Google Glass thing into a more human-friendly product. 8 years from now people will be saying, \"Google did that first\".",

There is something called \" timing the market.\" You can't force the market to adopt something like this, not-to-mention pay $1,500 for something they don't need. There is no use case where you actually need this. Apple timed the market perfectly by launching the iPad after the iPhone. Reversing that order of those two products, we would not have seen the same adoption rate. People are on their phones all of the time and they're not on their tablets all of the time. Wearing something on your face and paying nearly 4-5-6 times the price? This isn't a case of people not wanting to adopt it. It's their failure to understand the market, develop a use case to create demand. Google needs to learn how to launch products better and on the case, they launched a product to the public, they reacted and now people in beta aren't participating because of the blow back. This is like Microsoft's surface table. Too expensive and the form factor is wrong. Three years later, Apple launches iPad. Perfect timing, perfect form factor because people saw the need.",
