You are presupposing that the other devices aren't creepy or that I accept them, which I do not. However those other devices, which I actually sell and install, aren't nearly as connected to the Internet in a meaningful way of identifying you and linking to various data points to do whatever with a full suite of apps.  The other thing is, do you really want your picture taken and recorded with a pinhole camera lens that makes you look like a fat mutant? Those lenses are very unflattering. And what about the guy in the urinal next to you that looks over and takes a picture of your shame? And what about when you get your ass beat when you walk into a bar with them? By adopting and promoting this technology is just another step to a full crowdsourced self surveillance of society and deeper invasion into personal privacy. Not to mention making people look so stupid. When your butt crack pic ends up on Facebook when you bent over, I think you'll come around.",
