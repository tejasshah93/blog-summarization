If you want to, you can go buy all the equipment you need to surreptitiously record for less than the cost of a new S4 (or is it S5 now?). There is no shortage of people selling the stuff. Hell, I know a couple stores that sell such equipment.\n\nGlass didn't introduce anything new here.

Most security cameras are looking for specific things (generally criminal activity).  There's a legitimate reason for them, although no doubt they are subject to abuse.\n\nSo if I go to a casino and see a security camera, I'm not bothered.  They have their reasons, I know what I'm signing up for, and if I'm not happy I don't have to walk in there in the first place.   But if I go to a friend's house for dinner, and learn that he has recorded the dinner conversation without my advance knowledge or permission, I'm not going back there.   If he asks my permission, he'd better have a good reason.  That's the way I feel about Glass.\n\nBTW, is there not a bit of irony in the fact that a guy who works for Mantech has the perspective that \"you're recorded six ways to Sunday every time you're in public and that Google Glass is nothing new in that respect\"???   \n\nBut in fact that's my point -- when I'm talking to someone who has approached me wearing Glass, I don't believe that I'm \"in public\".

If they're being reflected from a public location in space and time then I personally consider it their right to do so and not my place to object. There are of course existing laws prohibiting what they might be doing in their own private space (eg plotting to kill me is not allowed etc) but generally I'm happy that those laws are already in place to protect me (more or less). If you or I as 'photon reflectors' don't like that, the solution most commonly adopted is to go into our private space (which I believe everyone should have) and stop scattering photons unimpeded in other people's direction. I do understand why you're objecting and don't consider it in any way a strange opinion to take but my position is that if we're ever going to get peace on this issue we need a definitive yet reasonably simplistic rule to decide appropriateness. I believe trying to agree upon regions of space and time as either public or private is the way forward. I obviously haven't conceived those principles perfectly but those would be the lines I would seek to follow to get closer to something we can agree on. Re 'secretly' recording, I'd like us to get to the point where we assume we are recording one another as much as we assume one another will neurally record (ie remember) the conversation we had. I just look at it as a device for enhancing the wearers memory and hope that eventually, once we've readjusted to this 'different norm', instead of feeling a bit 'creepy', which to some extent I agree it does right now, it makes me feel quite pleased that someone considered a conversation with me worthy of capturing in this way.",

It's as if you're assuming that people will be wasting their battery and time recording some random conversation with you. I'd also like to say that the social acceptability of these kinds of immersive things will be increasing exponentially in the next decade. It's gonna be something we all have to cope with. And as far as a simple alert for those possibly being recorded (an led indicator,) that's obviously something that will be added seeing as the product is in very early stages. And I can see maybe that, since you appear to be a ranking member of the job world with potentially important information in that brain of yours, you'd be slightly more concerned than most about privacy..just an assumption..but on that note this whole debate and most like it can be summarized into an adjustment in personal responsibility. If glass users would be respectful of others privacy, and other would be respectful of those using glass, then there's no problems. But in that you can see that no easy solution can or will be found. And I feel to many people are focusing on the negative aspects instead of the potential for greatness in this idea. Maybe there's a reason they left the light off. One practical thing I could think of for this would be in the operation room. Say an expert surgeon is performing a complicated and difficult procedure, and wants to record it for later review and maybe give it to a medical school for teaching purposes, or maybe he himself is a professor. Something like that has never been so available, and easy to use. Maybe that blinking light would be highly distracting in a situation like that where the utmost focus is a paramount importance.

      "message": "Bob Dana Maybe such etiquette should be considered a thing of the past then. For instance, if you discussing beverage preferences with you wife and your displeasure at your hosts ineptitude I see no reason you wouldn't want that conversation recorded, other than keeping your views from said host. Maybe it would be better to have simply had that conversation (in the politest way possible) directly with the host themselves. Consider the benefits it may have on our posterity. Imagine being able to be nearly fully immersed in times long past. What if glass had existed during world war II? What more could we learn if we could have such an in depth view of the past? Just thing to consider that may help ease your mind of this issue. I'm sure that Google has no Ill-will at heart when it come to glass and from whatever stand-point, they are making the decisions they make for a reason, even if we don't know what that reason is. I have faith that progress will prevail in one way or another. I see no harm in something that couldn't really set us back at all. So some of us will sacrifice a little privacy here and there for benefits we might not even be able to imagine now and as we all know, it's still in its early stages. Plus, like I said before..if there's any way for a phone to detect glass, someone will most certainly make an app for that, then I think your worries would be solved!",

      "message": "Bob Dana Why wouldn't you keep talking about that? If you believe it and consider it worthy of note why should be be ashamed of that? The google glass wearer could listen and remember as well as he could record, in either case he could go and tell on you to the host and the host could either decide to believe him/her or not. In this case there would be different levels of evidence but ultimately both reflect the truth and in either case the host could also choose to then confront you about it or not. When confronted you could then make the decision to explain why you thought Korbell would have been a better choice or outright deny it (ie lie). My hope would be that you would explain why you believed Korbell would have been a better choice, the host would then learn something new and be grateful or better appreciate the incredible subtleties behind the process of in champagne selection. If instead the host decides to bear a grudge against you for such a trivial difference of opinion you might find your life enriched by not being invited to his/her cocktail parties in future. And no doubt suffer for not having reasonable, knowledgeable people at his cocktail parties to enjoy and learn from.\n\nWhat I find most interesting in this case however is that the existence of google glass has actually made the third party's job of convincing the host you said you \"hated his guts and thought he/she was an arrogant tosspot\" MUCH MORE DIFFICULT than without. Which, having been to a few cocktail parties in my time, is a really good thing!",

Which would you prefer others to wear?\n\nI would prefer to wear the LED version because I believe that unless it's already obvious, I have a moral duty to inform my companions if I'm recording them.

And that to percieve being recorded as blatant disrespect would indicate to me that the individual with those views likely has some minor mental imbalances. To feel disrespected without being physically violated or even spoken to is ridiculous, if no one meant to disrespect you intentionally then you should have no reason to feel disrespected. \n\nBob! Your perspectives are in no way unjust.  I personally see no real reason for glass to  NOT release an LED alert version. But mentioning courts is a terrible idea. It's pretty common knowledge that the judicial system fails miserably on a regular basis. \n     But let me ask you this Bob say in an incredible circumstance, at one of those parties you mentioned, you notice someone wearing glass and respectfully ask they take it off, or leave you immediate vicinity. However, this man pulls you aside and officially identifies himself and an undercover FBI agent participating in an important investigation on a member of the party, therefore was gathering necessary data on said person of interest. Would you still insist this behavior was unacceptable? And what if it were in lesser circumstances, say a social psychology professor is out and about gathering practical social data for a research paper? What if he did, and did not ask your permission in separate imaginative circumstances. Just out of curiosity. (Obviously in all circumstances mentioned, glass lacks any notification of recording.)",

      "message": "Brandon Isaacs Brandon, good questions.  The FBI agent case in not realistic, because if he needed to secretly record video he would not put the camera on his face.  He would use any of the spy cams already available to him.  I would not object to this, because I would (perhaps naively) trust that his use of the technology was pre-approved, consistent with the law, and generally governed by the will of our democratically elected government.  As Winston Churchill said, \"democracy is the worst form of government except for every other.\"\n\nThe professor example is much more interesting, and would have to depend on some additional facts, but I'm generally not opposed to secret video recording if it's for a very good reason (and scientific research would often qualify, IMO).  It would not matter to me whether she asked my permission before or after the recording, just before she used it.  I would expect her to protect my privacy to the extent possible consistent with her scientific objectives, and to destroy the recording when no longer useful to her. \n\nAs I've said several times in this (now overly long) chain, it all boils down to intent.  I'm fairly liberal about interpreting intent, however \"just let me secretly record you and I'll determine later what to do with it\" definitely does not cut it for me.",

      "message": "Brandon Isaacs I think it's bold and somewhat misguided to think that a device like Glass should do away with our ability to have private conversations such as Bob's example of drink choice, etc.  In what way would it help the world to have everyone's personal opinions recorded and ready for viewing?  You assume that a more open and honest world is the next step in evolution, and where transparency in government and availability of information is important and a necessary addition to a better world, I don't assume that knowing my neighbor's true feelings on my wardrobe or drink selection is in any way necessary or beneficial.  At this point it seems that Google created a device and now the public is faced with deciding its benefit.  I think you gave the example of a Surgeon using Glass.  There are many professional uses that I can see as fantastic uses, but I would be in full acceptance of a public ban on wearing Glass because of the implications it has on personal privacy.  Yes, phones and other recording devices are readily available and present in public, but a phone has many other necessary uses and is more obvious when being used for other means.  I have yet to figure out a single good (non-professional or specialized) reason as to why Glass is at all useful except in cases where you can't use your hands, except most of those hands-free moments are in situations where you shouldn't be diverting your attention to your email, etc.",

      "message": "Dan Feeney You seem to be stuck in a rather narrow tunnel of perspective. Firstly I'm not taking a particular stand necessarily about anything. Mostly I try to simply put out ideas that get people thinking in some way and it seems I've accomplished that goal many times here. Anyway in what way would having all peoples opinions available for viewing make a better world? Well i can't really answer that, but I can ask you in what way it wouldn't make a better world. No one can say for sure, but the potential benefits outweigh the potential damages from my stand-point. Why..because all information, however insignificant is valuable, many times in ways were aren't even aware of. You can't say for sure the effects of knowing things you don't now know would be on you, because you don't know what you don't you, you can only speculate. So essentially it's the age old question of \"Is it better to know, or not to know?\" \n\nFrom my perspective, the potential here is exciting. There's a great many things that could come of glass, many of which we cannot anticipate yet. Even things that appear to be bad now, may prove beneficial in the future. I just thinks it's important for people to look at situations like this from all angels and really putting serious critical thought into before jumping to conclusions about the entire thing. Wanting to ban something like this because of a fear of privacy related more or less to one specific function or lack thereof is just silly if you consider how much more there really is to it, and the possibilities for the futures ESPECIALLY since it's in the early stages of its existence.
