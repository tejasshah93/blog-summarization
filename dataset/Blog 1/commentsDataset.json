Recently, I was offered a 2nd time, the price however had increased to $1600 plus tax and shipping.  I turned it down the second time.  \n\nI'm a Google fan and use all the products, but the idea of paying $1600 plus tax and shipping for the honor of beta testing Google's hardware and software is insulting.  Google should pay ME to test the product, not the other way around.\ufeff",

If someone is recording me with a phone, I know it.  The answer to the question they pose could be totally different if you have the opportunity to record surreptitiously and I don't.\n\nHonestly, it's totally shocking how tone deaf Google (and some of the media's reporting) is on the subject of the front facing, LED-less camera.\n\nLet me spell it out, Eric:  The only thing wrong with Google Glass is that it makes it too easy to record others without their knowledge or permission.  Fix that, and all these PR issues will go away.  Don't fix it, and no amount of propaganda will stop me (or anyone else with half a brain) from asking Explorers to remove their Glass when they talk to me.\n\nAre you listening?????\n",

In the new world, to be rich and powerful by definition, you have to leave massive trails of recorded interactions on the internet, thus are less private by definition - the new democracy. This balance is not there yet... as a matter of fact there is still a massive imbalance hence the recent NSA security scandals and the fact that hackers and criminals can remain 'anonymous' - it is getting harder for them to cover their tracks...\n\nIt is a change that has been creeping on us a while... and it is the inevitable track of technological progress I happen and others believe too... Google know this already.\n\nRead the recent interview of Kevin Kelly on Edge.org and/or on Wired for more on 'The Technium' and 'Why You Should Embrace Surveillance, Not Fight ' and this perspective spelled out much more eloquently then I have above.... \n\nHere are the links:\n\nThe Technium\nhttp://www.edge.org/conversation/the-technium\n\nWhy You Should Embrace Surveillance, Not Fight It\nhttp://www.wired.com/opinion/2014/03/going-tracked-heres-way-embrace-surveillance/",
