Comments Oriented Blog Summarization:
==========

A summarization technique for blogs like TechCrunch using its comments

To run,

```

The argument passed as an URL can be from TechCrunch (current implementation)

Output would contain the status of crawler and word extracted from the comments and their corresponding weight.
